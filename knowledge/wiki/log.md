# Knowledge and development log

## [2026-10-09] plan | Requirements and OSS research

Investigated CLI subprocesses, existing authentication, worktrees, human approval.
Added Rust/TDD, agentmemory, LLM-wiki, RTK/Ponytail/Graphify/CocoIndex constraints.
Recorded OSS comparison and headless/resume contracts in [protocols](cli-protocols.md).

## [2026-10-09] task | Design documents

Linked requirements → BG → SF → UC → QAS → DD → TDD implementation plan.
This was a documentation task, not the start of product execution implementation.
Initial architecture: Rust/SQLite/CLI-pager; optional memory/indexing sidecars.

## [2026-10-09] verify | Licenses and contracts

Excluded ao code reuse for unconfirmed license. Distinguished agentmemory Apache-2.0
from iii Apache-2.0 AND Elastic-2.0. Recorded conduct text output and Vibe Kanban
app-server/serve differences from requested exec/run. At this stage, product execution,
TDD tests, performance and transitive distribution checks had not been performed.

## [2026-10-09] complete | Research and design

Verified 15 Markdown files, zero broken local links, seven stage documents.
Research/design complete; T-01–08 implementation not complete. Saved findings and
outstanding verification to shared agentmemory.

## [2026-10-09] complete | T-01 Profile and plan foundation

Red: five failed, three passed. Green: eight passed. cargo test and clippy passed.
Commit 6391f7d; design commit 33a3edf. Created private neodamul/AgentConductor repository.

## [2026-10-09] verify | T-02 State foundation

Red: three failed, one passed. Green: four passed. Transitions and audit events share
one transaction. Verified resume transitions, duplicate events, database reopen.
Single-executable requirement: bundled SQLite, separate optional sidecars.
Commit 37e7860 pushed; total 12 tests passed. Full recovery scope remains pending.

## [2026-10-09] plan | Documentation and interface preview

User requested README UI, English documents/Korean communication, and exclusion of
internal decisions/development plans from README. Scope: translate all Markdown, retain
source references/IDs and evidence, add a labeled mockup. No implemented UI is claimed.

## [2026-10-09] task | English migration and public README

Translated documentation. Replaced README with product-facing content. Added original
SVG and a PNG preview. An intermediate README referenced an image before its file existed;
corrected the broken reference. Git history preserves pre-migration log/source wording.

## [2026-10-09] verify | Preview and document checks

Rendered the SVG locally and inspected the PNG. Initial Quick Look aspect handling cropped
the image; rendering on a square canvas and cropping blank padding preserved the full design.
Verify local links, English-only text, XML structure, image dimensions, and Git diff before commit.

## [2026-10-09] complete | Documentation and preview

Verified 15 English Markdown files, zero broken local links, valid SVG XML, 1280×880 PNG,
and clean Git diff whitespace. Visually inspected all preview panels. Saved requirements and
progress to shared agentmemory mem_mv0xsakb_73793144f244. This completes the documentation
change, not the UI or orchestration implementation.

## [2026-10-09] plan | Optional worktrees and human controls

User changed worktree separation to an option and requested a less web-like interface with
visible intervention controls. Shared is the default; worktree is explicit. Shared-mode
policy requires disjoint scopes, a clean baseline, no worker Git mutations, quiescent tests,
and aggregate review with unverified per-worker attribution.

## [2026-10-09] task | Workspace plan schema and console concept

Added workspace_mode (shared/worktree), backward-compatible shared default, and unknown-mode
rejection. Redesigned the preview as a terminal console with task selection, goal/feedback
entry, pause/resume/revise, workspace selection, and inspect/approve/reject controls.

## [2026-10-09] verify | Workspace schema

Red: two new tests failed while eight existing tests passed. Green: 14 tests passed overall;
clippy passed. Actual workspace execution/scheduling and UI controls remain unimplemented.

## [2026-10-09] complete | Workspace option and revised preview

Plan schema, English documentation, and revised console illustration verified. All local
links resolve; SVG parses; PNG is 1280×940 and all interaction controls are visible.
Shared/worktree execution and interactive controls still require later implementation.
