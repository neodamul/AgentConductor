# Current-main behavior carried into the Rust UI branch

## Scope

This checkpoint ports the v0.1.32 main-branch contracts for issues #79, #80, #82, #83, #84, #95, #100, and #103 into issue #9's Rust-only branch. The port keeps application behavior in Rust and excludes the upstream JavaScript UI and CJS tests.

## Architecture

- Task-scope path matching reuses plan::overlaps, so path casing follows the supported filesystem semantics while writes still require the task's owned scope.
- Shell command forms use the shared fail-closed classifier. Unknown or concatenated forms continue through the human-approval gate.
- Remote MCP authorization headers accept validated environment references; resolved secrets are not written into diagnostics.
- Quota reset timestamps use the IANA timezone database, including daylight-saving transitions.
- A successful self-update clears the update download root after replacing the installed app. Failed replacement preserves its files for diagnosis.
- Normalized task events update one bounded task-activity document. Agent Room reads a snapshot containing the current tool, elapsed time, age of the last event, and owned-process observation. Silence is not described as thinking or failure.
- Running-task feedback uses the existing active-feedback queue. Agent/model changes for pending tasks use a run-database document and are applied by the scheduler before launch. A running task cannot be reassigned.

No API-key provider integration, local UI web server, extra polling service, or agent-to-agent free-form channel is introduced.

## TDD and verification

Rust regressions for the upstream contracts were added before porting and failed on the missing behaviors. Native UI regressions cover active feedback, pending reassignment/model changes, immutable running ownership, activity text in English/Korean, and the snapshot contract. The focused local batch passed 36 tests across 12 suites. The full local run passed 800 tests with 14 ignored across 271 suites. Formatting, diff checks, public-document checks, the authored-file source-layout test, and warning-denied all-target Clippy passed.

The release-profile macOS package for commit `3739f65` passed its packaged workflow smoke in shared/worktree modes with Git and folder sources (four cases, three tasks each); approved merge succeeded and unapproved merge was refused. ZIP CRC passed. Evidence: `docs/evidence/issue9-3739f65-packaged-smoke.json`; archive SHA-256 `c08080c1d041bb5ef94a5c6865af85f8b9c1bdb42109303c6cbe79c587ae4382`; binary SHA-256 `1a7831dc567c5fc93859d5949dcb6cb9d7643fb26e0fe65ea65d81894805f741`. Exact-package UI, Windows package/UI, and GitHub Actions completion remain open. These code, test, and smoke results do not increase packaged issue #9 acceptance or indicate that the Rust UI is ready to ship.

## Source map

src/guard/policy.rs, src/guard/forms.rs, src/mcp/config.rs, src/quota/zones.rs, src/update/install.rs, src/activity.rs, src/state/history.rs, src/briefing.rs, src/native_ui_probe/room/task_activity/, src/native_ui_probe/room/task_controls/, and src/workflow/pending_edit.rs.

## Provenance

The behaviors were compared against origin/main v0.1.32 commit 3123ece. Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock changed only for the v0.1.32 package version; this port adds no external dependency or license obligation. Graphify's code-only extraction contains 7,699 nodes and 13,223 edges. CocoIndex could not run because its configured Python environment lacks mcp.server.fastmcp. The integration is tracked by GitHub issue #9 and its draft PR #22.
